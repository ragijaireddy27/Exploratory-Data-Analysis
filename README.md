# COVID-19 and Data Exploration Portfolio Project

Welcome to my **COVID-19 and Data Exploration Portfolio Project**! This repository showcases various data exploration and analysis techniques used across different platforms like **SQL**, **Excel**, **Power BI**, and **Python**. It includes SQL queries, data cleaning, pivot tables, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on datasets related to **COVID-19** and **sales data**.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **COVID-19 Data Exploration (SQL)**
- This SQL file contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) queries performed on a **COVID-19 dataset**. The queries help in understanding the structure, handling missing data, and identifying trends related to the pandemic.
- **File**: `COVID 19 with(eda) - Data Exploration.sql`

### 2. **Small EDA Queries (SQL)**
- This SQL file contains a small-scale EDA with basic queries to explore dataset columns, null values, and statistical summaries.
- **File**: `EDA_small.sql`

### 3. **Pivot Tables in Excel**
- This Excel file demonstrates the creation of pivot tables to explore and summarize data. It includes visualizations and insights derived from the dataset using pivot tables.
- **File**: `Pivot Tables in Excel.xlsx`

### 4. **Data Cleaning in MySQL**
- This SQL file showcases how data cleaning is done in MySQL, including handling null values, duplicates, and outliers in datasets.
- **File**: `data_cleaning_in_mysql.sql`

### 5. **EDA with DAX in Power BI**
- This Power BI file demonstrates **EDA with DAX** (Data Analysis Expressions) on a sales dataset. It includes advanced calculations, aggregations, and visualizations for in-depth analysis.
- **File**: `EDA_with_DAX on sales.pbix`

### 6. **Exploratory Data Analysis on Online Retailer (Python)**
- This Jupyter notebook contains **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** for an **Online Retailer Dataset**, including visualizations, trend analysis, and key insights.
- **File**: `Exploratory_Data_Analysis_on_online_retailer.ipynb`

### 7. **Help with EDA Report Queries (SQL)**
- This SQL file contains queries that assist in generating reports for exploratory data analysis and insights. It can be used to explore datasets and generate the necessary statistics.
- **File**: `with_help_od_EDA_report_queries.sql`

## Dataset

The datasets used for EDA and analysis include:

- **COVID-19 Data**: A dataset related to the global spread of COVID-19, including confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries by country.
- **Sales Data**: A dataset of online retailer sales, including transaction details, product information, and customer demographics.
- **Online Retailer Data**: Transactional data from an online retailer, used for analysis and visualizations.
  
The data comes in various formats including **SQL**, **Excel**, **Power BI**, and **CSV**, depending on the platform used for analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL**: Used for querying datasets, data cleaning, and generating EDA reports.
- **Excel**: Used for creating pivot tables and visualizing data insights.
- **Power BI**: Used for creating interactive visualizations and applying DAX formulas for EDA.
- **Python (Jupyter Notebooks)**: Used for performing EDA and creating visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
- **DAX**: Used in Power BI to perform advanced calculations and aggregations.

## Workflow

1. **COVID-19 and Small EDA Queries (SQL)**: Perform initial data exploration using SQL queries to examine the dataset structure and basic statistics.
2. **Pivot Tables in Excel**: Explore and summarize the data using pivot tables, with insights visualized through charts.
3. **Data Cleaning in MySQL**: Clean the dataset by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and correcting data types.
4. **EDA with DAX in Power BI**: Use **DAX** formulas in Power BI for aggregating data and creating interactive reports with various visualizations.
5. **Exploratory Data Analysis on Online Retailer (Python)**: Analyze an online retailer dataset using Python libraries for EDA and create visualizations to uncover key insights.
6. **Help with EDA Report Queries (SQL)**: Generate detailed EDA reports using SQL queries.
